Edited version
========
This edited version include all registered creatures that are used on systems like: Bestiary, Prey, Boosted etc.

- Monster window:
   Some informations on the monsters window can change colors when picked, the red highlight means that or this change wont have any effect (for example setting a addon number on a outfit that dont have addons) or if the value is confliction with another list, this last one happens on the ' ID: ' textbox, where the ID set on this place is already being used by another different creature, saving a new creature that have the ID with red colors will overwrite the old monster to the new one. 
	
- Quests/bosses:
   This information is used on some systems like the ['Team Finder'](https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&id=5586) and others like character info.

- Achievements:
   The achivements part is used to show on the player cyclopedia with the specific name, description and the grade (difficulty) of the achievement.
   
- House:
   The house tab can be used to edit the house informations or customize every part of it by importing a .dat file generated by my edited version o [Remeres map editor v4.+](https://github.com/marcosvf132/rme/tree/v4.0)
